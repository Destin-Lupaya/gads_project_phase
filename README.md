Google Africa Developer_ Associate Cloud Engineer
Better late than never, after 3 months of hard work I finally
did all the Quicklabs of the project phase, and I think I have better explored
all the corners of the cloud, and I think I have understood the workings and mastered
the goal of this track which was probably architecting with google computer engine.
I will not be certified as a Cloud Engineer this year maybe but I am proud to have given
my best and I already consider myself as an Associate Cloud Engineer or I am probably becoming one. 
Thank you to Google and to all the Andela team for this opportunity that made today these 5 years. 
Please follow me and put stars on my bash project.

Note: This project was made by quicklabs and it was not directly come from Google cloud platform
